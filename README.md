Hi,

My name is Saad Sheikh and I like to make websites and work with geological information.
This is my first project. It takes LATLONG values from Google Firebase and displays them on a stylized Google Map.
The site also has functionality for update posts, announcements, and the mandatory About Us page.

What I learned from this project, I am applying to my current project which is a desktop app that uses Electron and node.js
to create a road trip map. More info upcoming.
